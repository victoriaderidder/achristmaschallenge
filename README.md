# A CHRISTMAS CHALLENGE

Originally created as a Christmas gift for my sister in 2021, A Christmas Challenge is a perilous journey fraught with monsters, obstacles, pitfalls...and clicking. Well, mostly clicking.

This is the beginning of a journey that will go on to span years. If you so choose, the next iteration can be found [here](https://github.com/victoriaderidder/christmas2022).

Good luck!
